# The Word Game
The front end for "The Word Game". See how many words you can get correct before you run out of time, or face off against a random opponent!

## How to play
* Type the words that show up on your screen.
* Get it right at your timer will go down!
* Get it wrong and your timer increases.
* The longer you survive, the faster the timer gets.

## Running the Game locally
Running the game locally requires both, this react project and [its sister project](https://github.com/JimFung/thewordgame-server). Node.js is also required for this project to run.
```
# Clone the project to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/JimFung/thewordgame-client.git

#navigate into the directory
cd thewordgame-client

# install dependencies through npm
npm install

# start the project
npm start
```

**Note**: This project will not work unless it's backend server is also running on your machine. You can find out more about it [here](https://github.com/JimFung/thewordgame-server)
